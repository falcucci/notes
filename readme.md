# Running Notes tree

## Prerequisites

Before you can run notes tree, you need to have the following installed:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook)

## Running

Once you have the prerequisites installed, you can run mdBook with the following command:

```
mdbook build
```

This will build the book from the Markdown files in the current directory.

You can also serve the book locally with the following command:

```
mdbook serve --open 
```

This will start a local web server and open the book in your default web browser.
